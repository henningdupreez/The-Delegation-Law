<h1>The Delegation Law</h1>

<p>Every major system now faces the same question.</p>

<p>Not whether machine intelligence is powerful.<br>
That is already settled.</p>

<p>The question is whether decisions should be delegated to it.</p>

<p>Until recently, this question did not exist.<br>
Machines executed instructions.<br>
Humans decided.</p>

<p>That boundary is gone.</p>

<p>Reasoning itself can now be performed by machines.<br>
At speed.<br>
At scale.<br>
Without fatigue.</p>

<p>This creates a new problem.</p>

<p>Delegation is no longer a technical choice.<br>
It is a structural one.</p>

<p>History shows that systems do not fail because they adopt new power.<br>
They fail because they delegate without a governing rule.</p>

<p>This document names that rule.</p>

<h2>The Law</h2>

<p><strong>A decision may be delegated to machine intelligence if and only if doing so does not degrade the integrity of the system over time.</strong></p>

<p>Nothing else matters.</p>

<p>Not capability.<br>
Not efficiency.<br>
Not competitive pressure.</p>

<p>If integrity degrades, progress is temporary.<br>
If integrity holds, progress compounds.</p>

<h2>What This Law Exists to Prevent</h2>

<p>Delegation fails in predictable ways.</p>

<p>Sometimes a decision should never have been delegated.<br>
Sometimes it works at first, then collapses as reliance spreads.<br>
Sometimes it succeeds locally while corroding the system quietly.</p>

<p>These failures are not moral.<br>
They are structural.</p>

<p>The law exists to surface them before delegation becomes irreversible.</p>

<h2>How the Law Is Judged</h2>

<p>The law is not enforced by intention or promise.<br>
It is enforced by readiness.</p>

<p>Readiness has three independent dimensions.</p>

<h3>Structural Alignment</h3>

<p>Does delegation remove a real limitation, or merely automate around it?<br>
If the underlying constraint remains, delegation only accelerates failure.</p>

<h3>Propagation Stability</h3>

<p>Does the decision remain sound as reliance spreads?<br>
If behavior degrades with scale, the system is not ready.</p>

<h3>System Integrity</h3>

<p>When the machine is wrong, misused, or attacked, does the system recover?<br>
If errors compound silently, delegation is unsafe.</p>

<p>Strength in one dimension does not compensate for weakness in another.</p>

<p>If any one fails, delegation fails.</p>

<h2>What the Law Is Not</h2>

<p>It is not a safety guideline.<br>
It is not an ethical framework.<br>
It is not a call for caution or speed.</p>

<p>It does not ask whether delegation is impressive.<br>
It asks whether it is survivable.</p>

<h2>Why the Law Must Be Explicit</h2>

<p>When a rule is implicit, delegation defaults to capability.<br>
Capability always outruns readiness.</p>

<p>Systems then learn too late.<br>
Corrections arrive after damage is done.<br>
Control is replaced by reaction.</p>

<p>An explicit law changes this.</p>

<p>It allows restraint without weakness.<br>
Progress without denial.<br>
Leadership without heroics.</p>

<h2>The Consequence of Ignoring the Law</h2>

<p>If delegation proceeds without integrity, the system does not fail loudly.<br>
It decays.</p>

<p>Judgment erodes.<br>
Responsibility diffuses.<br>
Recovery becomes impossible.</p>

<p>By the time collapse is visible, delegation is already total.</p>

<h2>The Consequence of Enforcing the Law</h2>

<p>When the law is enforced, delegation becomes durable.<br>
Scale strengthens the system instead of hollowing it out.</p>

<p>Human judgment does not disappear.<br>
It relocates.</p>

<p>From execution to design.<br>
From reaction to supervision.<br>
From heroics to structure.</p>

<h2>Closing</h2>

<p>Machine intelligence makes delegation inevitable.<br>
This law makes it governable.</p>

<p>Progress will continue either way.</p>

<p>The only open question is whether it will endure.</p>
