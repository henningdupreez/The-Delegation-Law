<h1>The Delegation Law</h1>

<!--The Delegation Law

Every major system now faces the same question.

Not whether machine intelligence is powerful.
That is already settled.

The question is whether decisions should be delegated to it.

Until recently, this question did not exist.
Machines executed instructions.
Humans decided.

That boundary is gone.

Reasoning itself can now be performed by machines.
At speed.
At scale.
Without fatigue.

This creates a new problem.
Delegation is no longer a technical choice.
It is a structural one.

History shows that systems do not fail because they adopt new power.
They fail because they delegate without a governing rule.

This document names that rule.
 
The Law

A decision may be delegated to machine intelligence if and only if doing so does not degrade the integrity of the system over time.

Nothing else matters.
Not capability.
Not efficiency.
Not competitive pressure.

If integrity degrades, progress is temporary.
If integrity holds, progress compounds.
 
What This Law Exists to Prevent

Delegation fails in predictable ways.

Sometimes a decision should never have been delegated.
Sometimes it works at first, then collapses as reliance spreads.
Sometimes it succeeds locally while corroding the system quietly.

These failures are not moral.
They are structural.

The law exists to surface them before delegation becomes irreversible.
 
How the Law Is Judged

The law is not enforced by intention or promise.
It is enforced by readiness.

Readiness has three independent dimensions.

Structural Alignment

Does delegation remove a real limitation, or merely automate around it?
If the underlying constraint remains, delegation only accelerates failure.

Propagation Stability

Does the decision remain sound as reliance spreads?
If behaviour degrades with scale, the system is not ready.

System Integrity

When the machine is wrong, misused, or attacked, does the system recover?
If errors compound silently, delegation is unsafe.

Strength in one dimension does not compensate for weakness in another.

If one fails, delegation fails.
 
What the Law Is Not

It is not a safety guideline.
It is not an ethical framework.
It is not a call for caution or speed.

It does not ask whether delegation is impressive.
It asks whether it is survivable.
 
Why the Law Must Be Explicit

When a rule is implicit, delegation defaults to capability.
Capability always outruns readiness.

Systems then learn too late.
Corrections arrive after damage is done.
Control is replaced by reaction.

An explicit law changes this.

It allows restraint without weakness.
Progress without denial.
Leadership without heroics.
 
The Consequence of Ignoring the Law

If delegation proceeds without integrity, the system does not fail loudly.
It decays.
Judgment erodes.
Responsibility diffuses.
Recovery becomes impossible.

By the time collapse is visible, delegation is already total.
 
The Consequence of Enforcing the Law

When the law is enforced, delegation becomes durable.
Scale strengthens the system instead of hollowing it out.

Human judgment does not disappear.
It relocates.
From execution to design.
From reaction to supervision.
From heroics to structure.
 
Closing

Machine intelligence makes delegation inevitable.
This law makes it governable.

Progress will continue either way.

The only open question is whether it will endure.-->
